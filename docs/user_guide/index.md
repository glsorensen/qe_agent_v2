## Core Workflow

The typical workflow when using the Test Coverage Agent involves:

1. **Initialize** - Point the agent at your repository
2. **Analyze** - Scan the codebase to identify modules, classes, and methods
3. **Detect** - Find existing tests and their relationships to implementation code
4. **Evaluate** - Calculate test coverage metrics and identify gaps
5. **Generate** - Create tests for untested code using AI assistance
6. **Validate** - Verify tests are correctly structured and follow best practices
7. **Report** - Create comprehensive reports on test coverage status

Each step is detailed in the corresponding section of this guide.

## Common Use Cases

- **CI/CD Integration**: Run the agent in continuous integration pipelines to monitor test coverage
- **Codebase Audit**: Analyze an existing project to identify testing gaps
- **Test Generation**: Quickly generate tests for untested code
- **Coverage Monitoring**: Track test coverage over time and maintain quality standards
