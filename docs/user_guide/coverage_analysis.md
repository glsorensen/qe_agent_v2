# Coverage Analysis

The coverage analysis component evaluates how well the existing tests cover the implementation code in a repository. It identifies gaps in test coverage and provides metrics to assess testing completeness.

## How Coverage Analysis Works

The coverage analysis process involves several steps:

1. **Test Execution**: Running existing tests to collect execution data
2. **Code Instrumentation**: Tracking which lines of code are executed during tests
3. **Metric Calculation**: Computing coverage metrics like line, branch, and method coverage
4. **Gap Identification**: Finding untested or poorly tested components
5. **Prioritization**: Ranking coverage gaps by importance

## Key Components

### CoverageAnalyzer

The `CoverageAnalyzer` class (found in `repository/coverage_analyzer.py`) is responsible for analyzing test coverage and identifying gaps. It provides methods to:

- Calculate coverage metrics for modules, classes, and methods
- Identify untested or poorly tested code
- Prioritize components for testing based on complexity and importance

```python
# Example usage of CoverageAnalyzer
from repository.coverage_analyzer import CoverageAnalyzer

analyzer = CoverageAnalyzer("/path/to/repo")

# Get overall coverage metrics
metrics = analyzer.calculate_coverage_metrics()

# Get untested methods
untested_methods = analyzer.find_untested_methods()

# Get prioritized list of components to test
priorities = analyzer.prioritize_testing_targets()
```

### CoverageReporter

The `CoverageReporter` class (found in `test_execution/coverage_reporter.py`) generates human-readable reports based on coverage analysis. It provides methods to:

- Create summary reports
- Generate detailed coverage reports
- Export reports in various formats

```python
# Example usage of CoverageReporter
from test_execution.coverage_reporter import CoverageReporter

reporter = CoverageReporter("/path/to/repo")

# Generate summary report
summary = reporter.generate_summary_report()

# Generate detailed report in HTML format
reporter.generate_detailed_report(format="html", output_path="./coverage_report")
```

## Coverage Metrics

The Test Coverage Agent calculates several coverage metrics:

### Line Coverage

The percentage of code lines that are executed by tests. This is the most basic form of coverage.

```
Line Coverage = (Lines Executed / Total Lines) * 100%
```

### Branch Coverage

The percentage of code branches (if/else conditions, switch cases, etc.) that are tested.

```
Branch Coverage = (Branches Executed / Total Branches) * 100%
```

### Method Coverage

The percentage of methods/functions that are executed by tests.

```
Method Coverage = (Methods Called / Total Methods) * 100%
```

### Class Coverage

The percentage of classes that have tests.

```
Class Coverage = (Classes with Tests / Total Classes) * 100%
```

## Configuration Options

Coverage analysis can be customized with several options:

- **Coverage Threshold**: Set minimum acceptable coverage levels (`--min-coverage`)
- **Coverage Type**: Choose which metrics to focus on (line, branch, method)
- **Include/Exclude**: Specify which modules to include or exclude from analysis
- **Report Format**: Select how coverage reports should be formatted

## Advanced Coverage Analysis

### Complexity-Weighted Coverage

Standard coverage metrics treat all code equally, but some components are more critical than others. The agent can perform complexity-weighted coverage analysis:

```python
from repository.coverage_analyzer import CoverageAnalyzer

analyzer = CoverageAnalyzer("/path/to/repo")

# Get complexity-weighted coverage
weighted_coverage = analyzer.calculate_weighted_coverage()
```

This analysis considers factors like:
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Method size
- Number of dependencies
- Business criticality

### Risk-Based Coverage Analysis

Identify high-risk, untested areas by combining coverage data with risk metrics:

```python
# Get high-risk, poorly tested components
high_risk_components = analyzer.identify_high_risk_components()
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Incomplete Coverage Data

If coverage analysis seems incomplete, ensure tests are properly executing:

```bash
# Run with debug logging
python run.py /path/to/repo --debug
```

### False Positives in Coverage

Sometimes code appears untested but shouldn't require tests (e.g., simple property accessors). Configure exclusions:

```yaml
# In .test-coverage-agent.yaml
coverage:
  exclude_patterns:
    - "**/models/**/__init__.py"
    - "**/migrations/**"
  exclude_functions:
    - "__str__"
    - "__repr__"
```

### Improving Coverage Analysis Performance

For large codebases, coverage analysis can be slow. Improve performance by focusing on specific modules:

```bash
python run.py /path/to/repo --include core,api --exclude tests,docs
```
