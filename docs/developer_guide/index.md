## Core Architecture Principles

The Test Coverage Agent is built on several key architectural principles:

1. **Modularity**: The system is composed of loosely coupled modules with clear responsibilities
2. **Extensibility**: Core components are designed for extension through inheritance or composition
3. **Configurability**: Behavior can be customized through configuration rather than code changes
4. **Testability**: Components are designed to be easily testable in isolation
5. **Performance**: Critical operations are optimized for performance with large codebases

## Key Design Decisions

### Module Organization

The codebase is organized into these primary modules:

- **Repository**: Components for scanning and analyzing repositories
- **Test Execution**: Components for running and validating tests
- **Test Generation**: Components for creating and managing tests
- **UI**: User interface components (CLI and Web interfaces)

### Technology Choices

- **Python**: Chosen for its strong ecosystem of analysis and testing tools
- **pytest**: Used as the primary testing framework
- **langchain**: Utilized for AI-powered test generation capabilities
- **coverage.py**: Integrated for accurate coverage measurement

### Extension Points

The agent provides several extension points:

- **Custom Test Templates**: Add templates for specific testing patterns
- **Custom Analyzers**: Create specialized code analyzers
- **Custom Reporters**: Implement custom report formats
- **Rule Plugins**: Add validation rules for test quality

Refer to [Extending the Agent](./extending.md) for details on implementing extensions.
