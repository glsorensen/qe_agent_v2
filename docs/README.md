# Test Coverage Agent Documentation

## Overview

Welcome to the documentation for the Test Coverage Agent - an AI-powered tool for analyzing and improving test coverage in Python projects.

This documentation is designed to be easy to navigate, understand, and maintain as the project scales. It provides comprehensive information for both users and developers.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

- **[Getting Started](getting_started/index.md)**: Installation, basic usage, and quick examples
- **[User Guide](user_guide/index.md)**: Detailed explanations of features and use cases
- **[Developer Guide](developer_guide/index.md)**: Contributing, architecture, and design decisions
- **[API Reference](api_reference/index.md)**: Detailed documentation for all modules and classes

## Maintaining This Documentation

### Documentation Principles

1. **Clarity**: Write in clear, concise language
2. **Completeness**: Document all features and APIs
3. **Correctness**: Keep documentation in sync with the code
4. **Accessibility**: Organize for easy navigation and understanding
5. **Examples**: Include practical examples for key features

### Adding New Content

To add new content to the documentation:

1. Identify the appropriate section for your content
2. Create or update Markdown files with your changes
3. Follow the established formatting and style conventions
4. Include code examples where appropriate
5. Update navigation links and indexes as needed

### Documentation Structure Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `test_detection.md` not `td.md`)
- Organize content hierarchically with clear sections and subsections
- Use consistent heading levels (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Cross-reference related content with relative links

### Markdown Guidelines

- Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) syntax
- Format code blocks with appropriate language tags
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Include tables for structured information
- Use emphasis (*italic*) and strong (**bold**) formatting judiciously

### Keeping Documentation Updated

As the project evolves:

1. Update documentation alongside code changes
2. Review documentation for accuracy periodically
3. Remove or update outdated information
4. Add documentation for new features
5. Improve existing documentation based on user feedback

## Building Documentation

This documentation is written in Markdown and can be viewed directly on GitHub or built into a static site using tools like MkDocs or Sphinx with the markdown extension.

### Using MkDocs

To build the documentation with MkDocs:

1. Install MkDocs: `pip install mkdocs`
2. Navigate to the project root directory
3. Run: `mkdocs build`
4. The built documentation will be in the `site` directory

### Using Sphinx

To build with Sphinx:

1. Install Sphinx and the markdown extension: `pip install sphinx sphinx-markdown-builder`
2. Navigate to the project root directory
3. Initialize Sphinx: `sphinx-quickstart`
4. Configure `conf.py` to use the markdown extension
5. Build the documentation: `sphinx-build -b html docs/ docs/_build/`
